# logo-generator

## Description

This web application helps create a very simple logo and will help you cut back costs on hiring graphic designers. It allows you to pick a shape, color for the shape, type out 3 characters of text, and pick a color for the text. It was made using node, JavaScript, and some packages including jest, inquirer, inquirer-maxlength-input-prompt, and fs. It was made to help me gain practice with Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
